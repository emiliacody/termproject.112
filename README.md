112 Term Project: Scotty-Man

My game is called Scotty-Man which is a Pac-Man inspired interactive game! The user controls Scotty's movement as it traverses through a randomly generated maze using DFS backtracking, collecting treats (dog bones) along the way! The user's score increases each bone that he/she picks up, and there is a tennis ball randomly placed somewhere on the maze that is a power up. Scotty is awarded three points at this power up! An enemy, which are bagpipes in my game, that use BFS pathfinding to locate the scotty dog. When hit, the player loses and may restart. 

To run the game, the user must have cmugraphics installed and the attached images in this folder in their file to run the game.

One shortcut command is pressing 'r' to restart the game. This starts the game over and restarts score at 0.

All fonts used are within the scope of cmugraphics.

There is one python file attached. I did my best to organize classes/my code, and in the future I will implement this practice to ensure easier experience for a user.
